**Key Insights**  
Big Sales Jump, But Profit Plummeted.  

Sales increased by 170.65% to $136.04 million.

Net profit dropped by 37.64% to - $2.28 million.

Despite higher sales, the company incurred an overall loss.

##Costs Exploded

Manufacturing costs nearly doubled (+99.01%).

Freight costs more than doubled (+138.22%).

Operational expenses surged (+105.64%).

These rising costs eroded profitability.

Gross Margin Improvement Didn't Help

Gross margin rose from 31.04% to 32.54%.

The small improvement was not enough to counter the rising expenses.

##Excess Inventory is a Problem

The company is holding too much inventory, indicating poor planning or forecasting.

This ties up cash and poses a risk if inventory becomes obsolete.

##Regional Sales Skewed

Most sales came from the Asia-Pacific (APAC) region, highlighting regional concentration risk.

Missing Details

Lack of clarity on which products or customers are contributing to:

##High sales growth

Significant losses

This limits insight into the root causes of the financial issues.
